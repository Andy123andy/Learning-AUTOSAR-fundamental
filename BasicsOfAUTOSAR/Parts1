#Basics Of AUTOSAR â€“ Part 1

AUTOSAR(AUTomotive Open System Architecture) is an open source layered software development standard for, but not limited to, automotive Electronic Control Unit(ECU).

AUTOSAR gives a layered top-down structure for software with relation between the software components.

The layered architecture of AUTOSAR can be divided into Basic Software(BSW), Runtime Environment(RTE) and Application/Software Component layer.

Basic Software layer can be further subdivided into:

1) Micro-controller Abstraction Layer(MCAL) - Provided by microcontroller company (e.g. Infineon, Renesas and so on);
2) ECU Abstraction Later - Provided by Vector Informatik or another vendor company;
3) Services Layer - Provided by Vector Informatik or another vendor company; 
4) Complex Device Driver(CDD) Layer - Create by owner of the ECU project.
5) .swc - Create by owner of the ECU project.
