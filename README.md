# Learning AUTOSAR or how to get started

AUTOSAR (Automotive Open System Architecture) is a standardization initiative of leading automotive OEMs and suppliers and was founded in autumn 2003. 

The goal is to develop a reference architecture for ECU software, which can overcome the growing complexity of software in modern vehicles.

The AUTOSAR development partnership released the first version of the "Adaptive Platform" (Release 17-03)
www.autosar.org/standards/adaptive-platform/release-17-03/

The current AUTOSAR specifications now consist of the traditional "Classic Platform", the new "Adaptive Platform" and the new "Foundation" (common specifications for Classic and Adaptive).

# Standards

## Overview

### Foundation (FO)
The purpose of the Foundation standard is to enforce interoperability between the AUTOSAR platforms.
Foundation contains common requirements and technical specifications (e.g. protocols) shared between the AUTOSAR standards.

### Classic Platform (CP)
The Classic Platform is AUTOSAR’s solution for embedded systems with hard real-time and safety constraints.

### Adaptive Platform (AP)
The Adaptive Platform is AUTOSAR’s solution for high-performance computing ECUs to build fail-operational systems for use cases such as highly autonomous driving.

### Acceptance Tests for Classic Platform (AT)
The standard Acceptance Tests for Classic Platform provides a compilation of test cases to support acceptance testing for a wide range of features of Classic Platform implementations.
