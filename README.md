# Learning AUTOSAR or how to get started with Automotive Open System Architecture

AUTOSAR (Automotive Open System Architecture) is a standardization initiative of leading automotive OEMs and suppliers and was founded in autumn 2003. 

The goal is to develop a reference architecture for ECU software, which can overcome the growing complexity of software in modern vehicles.

## AUTOSAR

Paves the way for innovative electronic systems that further improve performance, safety and environmental friendliness

Is a strong global partnership that creates one common standard: "Cooperate on standards, compete on implementation"

Is a key enabling technology to manage growing electrical/electronic complexity. It aims to be prepared for the upcoming technologies and to improve cost-efficiency without making any compromise with respect to quality

Facilitates the exchange and update of software and hardware over the service life of the vehicle

The AUTOSAR standard will serve as a platform upon which future vehicle applications will be implemented and will also serve to minimize the current barriers between functional domains. It will, therefore, be possible to map functions and functional networks to different control nodes in the system, almost independently from the associated hardware.

## In a nutshell why AUTOSAR?

a.       Demands for more services, security, economy and comfort.

b.      Increase in complexity due to increase in number of ECUs and growth of software sharing and functionality.

c.       More diverse set of hardware and networks

The AUTOSAR development partnership released the first version of the "Adaptive Platform" (Release 17-03)
www.autosar.org/standards/adaptive-platform/release-17-03/

The current AUTOSAR specifications now consist of the traditional "Classic Platform", the new "Adaptive Platform" and the new "Foundation" (common specifications for Classic and Adaptive).

# Standards

## Overview

### Foundation (FO)
The purpose of the Foundation standard is to enforce interoperability between the AUTOSAR platforms.
Foundation contains common requirements and technical specifications (e.g. protocols) shared between the AUTOSAR standards.

### Classic Platform (CP)
The Classic Platform is AUTOSAR’s solution for embedded systems with hard real-time and safety constraints.

### Adaptive Platform (AP)
The Adaptive Platform is AUTOSAR’s solution for high-performance computing ECUs to build fail-operational systems for use cases such as highly autonomous driving.

### Acceptance Tests for Classic Platform (AT)
The standard Acceptance Tests for Classic Platform provides a compilation of test cases to support acceptance testing for a wide range of features of Classic Platform implementations.
